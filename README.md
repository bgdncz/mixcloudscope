Mixcloud Scope
=============

[Mixcloud](http://www.mixcloud.com/) is a very popular music website/service with mixes, podcasts etc. As [Wikipedia says](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixcloud "Wikipedia"):
> Mixcloud is an online music streaming service that allows for the listening and distribution of radio shows, DJ mixes and podcasts, which are crowdsourced by its registered users. Its notable users include Wired, Harvard Business School, TED Talks, and Barack Obama. Mixcloud was originally funded by its founders only and continues to be owned solely by its team.

Inspiration
=============

I was inspired by [Daniel Holbach](http://www.mixcloud.com/dholbach/ "Mixcloud")'s mixes to create this scope and (as it turned out) a showdown took place for Ubuntu scopes. I began work with almost 0.5 knowledge on C++ and 1 of Qt (never mind the scale and I know it's weird, but Qt makes everything better, including C++). David Callé's tutorials are wonderfully written (of course), but I preffer videos and it turned out I was on a lucky streak, 'cause a few videos have been uploaded regarding scope development.

The API
=============

I am not advertising, but I must say that [Mixcloud's API](http://www.mixcloud.com/developers/ "The docs") documentation is very well written, it was very easy to follow.

Big thanks
=============

Big thanks to: Daniel Holbach, David Planella & David Callé (all part of the Canonical team, making the world a better place one scope/app/line of code/tutorial/mix/translation etc. at a time).
